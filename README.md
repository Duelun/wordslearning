My first Complex project in Laravel 10 and Bootstrap 5 and - of course - with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MSQL.

The website offer a word learning app. The base engine is the usually show-write-remember-write-repeat sytem but the repeat number and its timing suit to the human brean's peculiarity.

At this time done:
 - Open page.
 - Login, register, change, forgott password system.
 - Authorization.
 - Validation. Prepared for planned features.
 - Localization. At this time with 3 languages.
 - Partial translation.
 - Color shema prepared.
 - Admin area prepared.
 - Documentum area prepared.
 - User setting area.
 - User learning database:
    - Dictionaries (words sets) create new, modify exist, delete.
    - Words (pair) create new, modify exist, delete, move between dictionaries.
 - Database prepare for the planned features.
 - Working Fetch function and prepared for the planned features.
 - Mostly responsive design.

Task in the future:
 - User learning are.
 - Connection to Google dictionary API.
 - System level word-pair database for prepared and inspected word-pairs.
 - User connection for thise database.
 - Admin area finish.
 - Translation finish.
 - Color shemas finish.
 - Written content finish.
 - Proper skin, pictures, formating.

Unfortunately, the visual design is not my strong side, so the skin is not the most beautiful. But I work on it... and hope :)
