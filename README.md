My first Complex project in Laravel 10 and Bootstrap 5 and - of course - with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MSQL.

The website offer a word learning app. The base engine is the usually show-write-remember-write-repeat sytem but the repeat number and its timing suit to the human brean's peculiarity.

At this time done
    - Login, register sytem.
    # The operation of the script:
 - It opens data file.
 - Structures the loaded datas into arrays.
 - Handles the datas as a cohesive package by measured oscillation of electrick sign in one period, the time of measure and the measured temperatures.
 - We can draw datas as graf into windows and/or print data values into table.
 - We can manipulate grafs by custom functions, compare two graf to each other.
 - We can add, extract, multiple etc. or process custom function on a graf or on two grafs related to each other.
 - We can take picture from any window.
 - Can save back the manipulated arrays into file.
